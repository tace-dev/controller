/** @page uart3_example_2 UART3 Example2: UART3 interrupt mode example


  @par Example description

	This example provides a short description of how to use UART3 peripheral in
	interrupt mode. Transmitted message is due to short connection received simultaneously
	and tested for correct receive after every transmission/receive cycle. Transmission
	speed is 57600 Bd, after a message transmission/receive cycle is about 65 ms delay
	inserted. In correct	state LEDs should shine permanently with no visible blinking.
	Message is a string terminated by NULL character and is transmitted and received throw
	the Tx and Rx buffers.

	This example has been tested with ST Visual Develop (STVD) toolchain on STMS208 device
	for both Cosmic and Raisonance compilers.
