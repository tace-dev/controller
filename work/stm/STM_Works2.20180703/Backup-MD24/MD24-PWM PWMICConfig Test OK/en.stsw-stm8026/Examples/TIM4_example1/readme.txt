/** @page tim4_example_1 TIM4 Example1: Toggling an output with TIM4 update interrupt 


  @par Example description

  This example provides a short description of how to use the TIM4 peripheral
	During this example, PG.5 will toggles each time the Update Interrupt occurs
	
	The input TIM4 CLK frequency is 2 MHz, initial value for the Prescaler is 128
	and for the Autoreload to 128. So the TIM4 counter clock is 15,625 kHz and pin
	PG.5 is toggling with period 61 Hz after reset and TIM4 generates an Update
	Interrupt each 8,2 ms. With every pressing button or joystick selection
	toggling period is multiplied by 2 by changing value of atuoreload or
	prescaler register till the limit at about 29 kHz. After next step program is
	toggling the pin with about 37 kHz period running completely in interrupt.

	This example has been tested with ST Visual Develop (STVD) toolchain on STMS208 device
	for both Cosmic and Raisonance compilers.
